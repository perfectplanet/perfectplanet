# 1.2 Decentralized finance

At present, the total number of people holding encrypted digital currency in the world has exceeded 20 million. This number was several million a year ago. The number of token users is growing exponentially, just like the exponential growth of currency prices. Coupled with the rise of DEX exchanges, centralized exchanges, centralized management and centralized governance have gradually been unable to survive in the digital currency circle. **Decentralization is the future of digital currency.** On the road to decentralization, DeFi has subverted the traditional financial model and has become the mainstream model of a new generation of encrypted digital currencies.

DeFi is the English abbreviation of Decentralized Finance, which is decentralized finance. It actually refers to a classified decentralized protocol built on a blockchain network and adopts a set of extreme, accessible and inclusive open finance. system. At present, our common banks and securities companies are relatively CeFi, which is the opposite of DeFi, centralized finance.

In August 2018, Brendan Forster, COO of Dharma Labs, released the report "Announcing De.Fi, A Community for Decentralized Finance Platforms", announcing the birth of DeFi. After iterations, the concept of DeFi has gradually evolved from the original "financial improver" to a "financial revolutionist". Blockchain technology has begun to transform from applications serving finance to reshaping finance, catalyzing its rapid implementation. After 2019, benefiting from the continuous improvement of the blockchain industry ecology, the industry has expanded the connotation and extension of DeFi: the movement of using open source software and decentralized networks to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols.

The financial industry is the key development direction of blockchain technology applications, and more than one-third of blockchain projects can be classified as DeFi. Based on the academic definition of finance and according to the BICS (Blockchain Industry Classification Standard) classification, among the top 1,000 tokens by market value, at least 38% of the blockchain projects directly serve the financial industry, including non- Banking finance, wallet, transaction, token asset management, stable token, banking application service and payment settlement.

According to statistics from Feixiaohao and CMC, since 2021, the total lock-up volume of DeFi has exceeded 100 billion US dollars, which is a rapid growth compared with DeFi in 2020. Many star projects are also rising rapidly, and the public chains that can be selected by the project have also evolved from the initial Ethereum network to the current situation of multiple public chains, such as Tron public chain, BSC public chain, HECO public chain, etc.

DeFi is inherently permissionless, and financial applications can be transformed, connected, and leveraged without restrictions. DeFi gradually uses smart contracts to replace privileged institutions in the traditional financial field, enabling users to enjoy financial services at extremely low costs, and improving the operating efficiency of the entire financial system and reducing operating costs. At thesame time, it will create a borderless financial system structure that is open to the world, so as to build an transparent and secure decentralized system, everyone can freely conduct transactions.

**DeFi platforms have two main advantages:**

Individuals with asset management needs can enjoy various financial services without trusting any intermediaries, and new trust is rebuilt on the code.

All protocols are open source, and anyone can cooperate on the protocol to build new financial products and accelerate financial innovation under the network effect.

At present, DeFi has developed stablecoins, lending, decentralized exchanges, derivatives, prediction markets, insurance, payment platforms and other models. Perfect Planet's financial consensus mechanism is a brand new DeFi3.0 model. It is believed that in the future, under the new financial landscape created by DeFi, the new DeFi tokens PPF & PPG will create more revolutions and innovations beyond imagination.
