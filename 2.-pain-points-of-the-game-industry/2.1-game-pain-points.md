# 2.1 Game Pain Points

Traditional games have many pain points:

**1. Data opacity:** Due to the opaque game data, developers can modify the rules arbitrarily, harming the interests of users. Game updates and users deviate from user demands, resulting in user loss.

**2. Few distribution channels:** distribution channels tend to be monopolized, and small game manufacturers have no right to speak, and the entire market presents a trend of polarization. The game development investment is large and the risk is high.

**3. The user has no ownership:** The props in the game belong to the game platform, and the user has no real ownership, and cannot carry out value circulation.

**4. No interoperability between games:** Game results cannot be migrated across platforms. Once the game stops operating, the player's previous game results will all disappear.
