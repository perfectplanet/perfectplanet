PPG and PPF will act as a unit of exchange to quantify and pay for the cost of computing resources consumed. Perfect Planetâ€™s Twin Tokens are an integral part of the Perfect Planet Network, as without tokens, users have no incentive to spend resources to participate in events or serve the interests of the entire ecosystem on the Perfect Planet Network. Only users who really contribute to the maintenance of the network will be rewarded with tokens.
