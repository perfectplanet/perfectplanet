# 4.1 The underlying protocol

Perfect Planet's underlying protocol is the BSC network, a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregate scalable solutions on Ethereum to support the multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.

Perfect Planet's underlying protocol is a second-layer scalability platform that enables fast, simple and secure off-chain transactions, not only payment transactions, but also generalized off-chain smart contracts. Worked on the implementation of Plasma MVP (Minimum Running Plasma), WalletConnect Protocol and Ethereum Event Alerting Engine - Dagger made outstanding contributions. Perfect Planet twin tokens are used for equity betting and participate in the proof consensus mechanism of the side chain network.

Perfect Planet's mission is to use decentralization, scalability, and security to drive large-scale applications through a two-tier scaling scheme, and to do this with sidechains for off-chain computing, using both the Plasma framework and decentralized PoS validator network to ensure asset security. Perfect Planet strives to solve the scalability and usability issues of the blockchain ecosystem without compromising on decentralization and leveraging existing development communities and ecosystems.

The protocol facilitates higher transaction throughput with a stronger framework, and currently, Perfect Planet is providing blockchain developers with the means to build world-class Dapps across multiple industries (e.g. decentralized finance, gaming, enterprise software, etc.). required resources. Perfect Planet aims to solve the above problems by providing a layer 2 scaling solution that enables scale by leveraging sidechains for off-chain computation while leveraging the Plasma framework and decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators to ensure asset security change. Perfect Planet will be the de facto platform for developers to deploy and run decentralized applications.

**1. Functional features**

**Scalability:** Fast and low-cost transactions on sidechains and confirmed on the main chain; BSC is the first compatible base chain.

**High throughput:** A single side chain of the testnet can already reach up to 10,000 TPS; multiple side chains will further help horizontal expansion.

**User experience:** smooth user experience and development abstraction layer from the main chain to the Perfect Planet chain; mobile applications and software development tools with WalletConnect support.

**Security:** The operator of the Perfect Planet network is also the equity owner of the PoS system.

**2. Infrastructure**

**Big data and AI layer**

The bottom layer of big data provides various data support for the upper-layer chain game application, and the AI ​​layer provides a series of auxiliary functions for the upper-layer application, such as intelligent calculation recognition, intelligent data matching, etc.

**Smart Contract layer**

Based on the smart contract layer of the Perfect Planet blockchain, it customizes a variety of smart contract templates that meet business scenarios, provides packaged smart contract APIs, and provides a development toolkit for custom smart contracts.

**Service layer**

Perfect Planet has assisted other blockchain applications to graft their own distributed application DApps. Perfect Planet provides a series of underlying data access and interactive interfaces based on multiple languages ​​to improve the service capabilities of the blockchain system service system, including registration and storage, transaction Targeted service interfaces such as records, ownership certificates, data query engines, etc., support multi-language integration and function expansion.
