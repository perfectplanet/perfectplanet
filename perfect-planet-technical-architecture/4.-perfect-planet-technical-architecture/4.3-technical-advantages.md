# 4.3 Technical advantages

**Maximizing Returns:** Returns are the focus of every investor. The reason why most people choose to invest in Gamefi or metaverse projects is that their yields are relatively high. Perfect Planet can maximize the output of Gamefi, and switch funds to higher yields according to the level of real-time computing power output. STAKING or liquidity mining in high-yield high-quality sectors provides higher returns for our investors. The rules of compound interest retention make efficient use of funds to maximize returns.

**Low operating threshold:** After Perfect Planet endows fixed assets such as computing power machines and computing power with a certain value liquidity through platform-specific methods, it lowers the entry threshold for the entire industry, and filters out DeFi application operations such as asset conversion, pledge, Pool selection, redemption, etc., users can participate in the ecosystem with one click.

**Low Gasfee:** In general, each step of a project requires 1-2 contract calls, and the cost per time ranges from $10 to $80. For example, ether, it may even exceed $100 when the ether network is congested. The Perfect Planet computing power pool is centralized, for example, 1,000 people only consume gas fee once, which can be close to zero gas fee loss for each user.
