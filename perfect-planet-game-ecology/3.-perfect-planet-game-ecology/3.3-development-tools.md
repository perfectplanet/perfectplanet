**1.PP Edit editing tool**

PPEdit is a 3D image editing tool that supports players or developers to build territories, including the following features:

**(1) Simple editor**

Simple editor requires no programming skills, just simple drag and drop to complete. When in use, players can select the desired items and drag them onto the map, and change the size at will to quickly use them to form a group of territories. These items include territory number, purchase time, maximum capacity, number of reprints, and more.

**(2) Modeling**

PP Edit has powerful rendering capabilities that allow professional voxel creators to get the models they want.

**(3) Animation**

PP Edit can also animate the work, so that the flag flutters in the wind and pets can walk, which increases the realistic effect of the picture. For optimal rendering in browsers or VR headsets, PP Edit uses one of the most powerful and sharpest rendering engines out there, and is completely free and open source to allow every player to translate their ideas into and create animations.

**(4) Export**

PP Edit supports players to export models in formats such as .OBJ, .DAE and .GLTF. After the user creates an item through the PP Edit editor, it will be directly saved as a BEP 721 standard NFT, which can be directly entered into the trading market for trading. These NFTs are placed on the player's corresponding territory, and the player can see it after clicking on the territory.

**2.PP GM game tool**

PP GM (PP Gamemaker) is a simple game editor that allows users to create creative mini-games by simply dragging and dropping without programming experience. PP GM contains a wealth of space game materials, players can use their imagination to create simple games. After the game creation is completed, the game promotional poster can be placed in the iconic position on the territory, and the logged-in players can click to enter the game. Games can help territory owners increase the stickiness of tourists and players and create economic income.
