# 3.4 NFT Authentication System

Perfect Planet's territorial ownership and store products are an NFT certification system, and NFT brings the possibility of IP ownership of virtual goods. In a centralized system, the company that created the platform can prevent and control copyright issues, but in a virtual platform, anyone can download content that already has ownership, and Perfect Planet can use a decentralized identity system to store items in the virtual world. Create an ownership layer on top.

Meanwhile, Perfect Planet Gamefi uses blockchain technology and NFTs to empower players and creators. NFTs are an emerging segment of the global gaming market: virtual tokens that represent digital scarcity, security, and authenticity. Each non-functionality is unique, indivisible and not interchangeable with another non-functionality.

Through the NFT certification system, players of Perfect Planet will be able to obtain fourfold guarantees:

**1. True Digital Ownership:** Even if the game is shut down or abandoned, players remain the true and permanent owners of their digital items. With NFTs, every game item can be tagged, allowing players to decide how they want to trade, sell, or gift their items.

**2. Security and immutability:** Digital game projects are often attacked, and even fraud and theft occur. The Perfect Planet chain game network adopts distributed ledger technology. If someone wants to change a block, it will cause the block to be blocked. The signature changes, which do not match those recorded in the subsequent block, thus disconnecting from the subsequent block. Therefore, data loss is impossible for Perfect Planet.

**3. Transactions:** Perfect Planet Gamefi can provide users with ultimate control over their digital assets. Users can freely buy and sell items without fear of being blackmailed or the platform shutting down and removing all value from their in-game items.

**4. Interoperability across applications:** Blockchain technology facilitates Perfect Planetâ€™s asset sharing. Assets, avatars, territories, and any other game elements can be used in other games of the game, and these game items are no longer limited to a narrow digital ecosystem.

In addition, the final direction of Gamefi is to serve as the entrance to the Perfect Planet metaverse. All user assets will be confirmed and their value will be redistributed and positioned. Players will redefine their identity in the digital world, asset pricing, secondary investment, and confirmation of rights. Let everyone have a second life.
