# 9. Perfect Planet Risk Parameters

As a new digital token, PPF\&PPG has various risks. Potential investors need to carefully evaluate investment risks and their own risk tolerance.

**Risks due to lost certificates**

After the purchaser's PPF\&PPG tokens are allocated to the purchaser, they will be linked to the purchaser's Perfect Planet account. The only way to enter the Perfect Planet account is the relevant login credentials selected by the purchaser. Losing these credentials will result in the loss of PPF\&PPG tokens. The best way to securely store login credentials is for the purchaser to separate the credentials in one or more places for safe storage, preferably not in public places or where strangers are present.

**Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials**

Any third party who obtains the purchaser's login credentials or private key may directly control the purchaser's PPF\&PPG tokens. To minimize this risk, buyers must protect their electronic devices from unauthenticated access requests and access to device content.

**Risks related to judicial supervision**

Blockchain technology has become the main object of supervision in major countries in the world. If the regulatory body exerts influence, Perfect Planet applications or tokens may be affected by it, such as legal restrictions on the use of electronic tokens and the sale of electronic tokens.

**Risk related to applications or products do not meet their own or purchaser's expectations**

The Perfect Planet app is currently in the development stage and may undergo major changes before the official version is released. Any Perfect Planet's own or purchaser's expectations for the Perfect Planet app or the function or form of the PPF\&PPG currencyor Imagination may fail to meet expectations. Any wrong analysis or changes in the underlying design may cause this to happen.

**Risk of hacking or theft**

Hackers or other organizations or countries may attempt to disrupt the Perfect Planet application or the functionality of the PPF\&PPG tokens in any way, including service attacks, Sybil attacks, guerrilla attacks, malware attacks, or consistency attacks. The rapid development of cryptography or the development of other related technologies such as the development of quantum computers may bring the risk of cracking to encrypted tokens and the Perfect Planet platform, which may lead to the loss of PPF\&PPG tokens.

**Risk of lack of maintenance or use**

The purchase of PPF & PPG tokens should be considered as a kind of support and investment in the development of Internet applications, rather than a speculation. Although PPF\&PPG tokens may have a considerable market value after a certain period of time, resulting in greater returns for early investors, but if the Perfect Planet platform lacks maintenance or insufficient applications, this appreciation does not have much practical significance .

**Risk of uninsured loss**

Unlike bank accounts or accounts with other financial institutions, storage on Perfect Planet accounts or on the Ethereum, BSC network is generally uninsured. Losses under any circumstances will not be covered by any public organization or individual.

**Other unforeseen risks**

Cryptographic tokens are an emerging technology, and in addition to the risks mentioned in this white paper, there are some risks that the blockchain industry itself and the Perfect Planet team have not yet anticipated.
