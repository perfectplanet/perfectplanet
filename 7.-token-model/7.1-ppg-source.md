PPG holders can participate in the management of the Perfect Planet ecosystem to ensure the stability, transparency and efficiency of the protocol. The Perfect Planet voting weight is proportional to the number of PPGs that voters have in the voting contract. In other words, the more PPG tokens that voters stake in the contract, the more decision-making power they have.

As a payment and settlement unit between the Perfect Planet network ecosystem, PPG tokens do not in any way represent the governing body, issuer, its affiliates or any other company.
