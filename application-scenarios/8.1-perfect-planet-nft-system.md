# 8.1 Perfect Planet NFT System

In-game assets represented by NFTs are expected to be traded and traded on Perfect Planet's sidechain in the future. Developers can also save game state on the sidechain if they wish. The full name of NFT is non-fungible token - non-fungible token. NFT comes from the concept of economics, that is, "non-fungible token", and it also allows people to directly understand its "irreplaceability". We can simply understand it as giving a digital work a unique ID in the world, and the person with this ID is the owner of the work. Although things that exist on the Internet are very easy to copy and paste, only those with this ID mark are genuine.

**Perfect Planet's NFT field will be divided into three sections. Except for Gamefi field, the other two fields are the field of art and the field of synthetic assets.**

**Art field:** More and more art creators and ordinary consumers are entering the NFT field. Digital artwork is just one area of ​​NFT applications, and the design ideas behind it may be changing the relationship between the virtual and real worlds. Owning an NFT artwork is equivalent to owning an on-chain certificate for artwork assets.

Encrypted art projects do not necessarily need a so-called business model, and the standards of various art works are also closely related to the preferences of the audience. However, the cryptocurrency attribute of NFT itself, the NFT platform that Perfect Planet is about to build, brings together thousands of artists and hundreds of thousands of works from around the world, setting a set of project design and distribution standards for NFT encrypted art projects .

**NFT asset synthesis:** Perfect Planet will create a new NFT synthesis protocol. Users can synthesize assets, mint and produce new coins, and the synthesized new Tokens can be launched online to earn interest, which is also a certificate for users to deposit assets in Perfect Planet. In the lending market, the locked funds can only be used after they are unlocked, and when they are withdrawn, the amount of funds that can be loaned by the lender will also be reduced. After the launch of a new synthetic token, this side effect can be avoided, because the funds deposited on the Perfect Planet platform will be circulated in the form of a new synthetic token in the open market, which will not affect the funds locked in the platform, so it will not Reduce the amount of funds from the borrower.
